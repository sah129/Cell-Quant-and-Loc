cutoff is 100 for Git1, 100 for pmvacquantratios


IMAGEJ:

For finding cutoff as an input param:

Analyze->set scale.  Click to remove scale

Analyze -> measure 


Idea for GUI:

Have them set cutoff and choose sample image.  Run the image for 4 or 5 different brightness levels, display all at once.  Let them pick which one looks best. 

Do this for DIC and GFP
